Variables by Category

Categories
----------

Industry is divided into the following categories. Note that emissions from industrial energy **ADD LINK** are accounted for in the energy sector.

All industrial categorization is derived from the *2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories*, Volume 3, *Industrial Processes* (see Chapter 1, page 1.7 for a chart describing these categorizations). The entire guidance is available from the `Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories <https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2019rf/index.html>`_
